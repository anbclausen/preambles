# Preambles for LaTeX
Welcome to my personal collection of preambles. I have built these preambles in my time at Aarhus University for handins, exams, and presentations. I hope they will be useful for you. Feel free to use, distribute and modify them!

## What can I do with your preambles?
Great question! See [Article Example](article-example.pdf) for an example of how to write an article/a document. This example also lists all features of all the preambles with examples. See also [Presentation Example](presentation-example.pdf) for an example of how to write a presentation.
